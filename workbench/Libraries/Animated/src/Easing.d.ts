/**
 * The `Easing` module implements common easing functions. This module is used
 * by [Animate.timing()](docs/animate.html#timing) to convey physically
 * believable motion in animations.
 *
 * You can find a visualization of some common easing functions at
 * http://easings.net/
 *
 * ### Predefined animations
 *
 * The `Easing` module provides several predefined animations through the
 * following methods:
 *
 * - [`back`](docs/easing.html#back) provides a simple animation where the
 *   object goes slightly back before moving forward
 * - [`bounce`](docs/easing.html#bounce) provides a bouncing animation
 * - [`ease`](docs/easing.html#ease) provides a simple inertial animation
 * - [`elastic`](docs/easing.html#elastic) provides a simple spring interaction
 *
 * ### Standard functions
 *
 * Three standard easing functions are provided:
 *
 * - [`linear`](docs/easing.html#linear)
 * - [`quad`](docs/easing.html#quad)
 * - [`cubic`](docs/easing.html#cubic)
 *
 * The [`poly`](docs/easing.html#poly) function can be used to implement
 * quartic, quintic, and other higher power functions.
 *
 * ### Additional functions
 *
 * Additional mathematical functions are provided by the following methods:
 *
 * - [`bezier`](docs/easing.html#bezier) provides a cubic bezier curve
 * - [`circle`](docs/easing.html#circle) provides a circular function
 * - [`sin`](docs/easing.html#sin) provides a sinusoidal function
 * - [`exp`](docs/easing.html#exp) provides an exponential function
 *
 * The following helpers are used to modify other easing functions.
 *
 * - [`in`](docs/easing.html#in) runs an easing function forwards
 * - [`inOut`](docs/easing.html#inout) makes any easing function symmetrical
 * - [`out`](docs/easing.html#out) runs an easing function backwards
