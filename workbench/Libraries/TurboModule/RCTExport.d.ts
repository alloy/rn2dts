/**
 * NOTE: This is React Native specific export type.
 *
 * DEPRECATED_RCTExport is an interface type that allows native code generation
 * for React Native native modules. It exists as a hint to the codegen tool that
 * any interface that extends it needs to be codegen'ed. Example usage:
 *
 *   export interface RCTFoobar extends DEPRECATED_RCTExport<void> {}
 *
 * Native definition for RCTFoobar will then be generated.
 *
 * The type param T is a placeholder for future codegen hinting, like versioning
 * information, native base classes, etc. For now, simply use `void` type as
 * there's nothing to give hint about.
 *
 * NOTE: This export is deprecated. Please us TurboModule.
